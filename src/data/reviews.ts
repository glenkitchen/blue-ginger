      "What a blessing Rachel has been over the years! She is more than just a petsitter she’s a gentle caring soul who treats animals like her own. She tunes into each personality with patience and love. She keeps us connected with regular videos & photos. If you’re an animal lover and need someone to care for your pet in your own home – Rachel is honestly the best, we can’t recommend her highly enough!",
