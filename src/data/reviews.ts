      "Rachel has looked after our fur children on a few occasions. We are really impressed with Rachel's great communication and expertise when it comes to animals. She makes sure to provide us with frequent updates. This puts our minds at ease and reassures us that our babies are in good trusted hands. The best thing about Rachel (I'm sure my dogs will agree) is that she takes them on a daily walk. This is a bonus as our dogs require regular walking. All in all, I would highly reccomend Blue Ginger petsitting through and through.",

      "Blue Ginger Petsitting is an exceptional Pet Sitting Service! We've had the pleasure of using Rachel and her team at Blue Ginger Pet Sitting frequently over the last 3 years, and we can't recommend them enough! Rachel provides top-notch care for our fur babies, giving us complete peace of mind while we're away. Her dedication and love for animals shine through in everything she does. From daily updates and photos to daily walks and playtime, Rachel goes above and beyond to ensure our pets feel loved and comfortable in their own home. In fact, our animals adore Rachel so much that we're pretty sure they love her more than us! Her ability to connect with our pets and provide personalized care is truly special. Rachel is also my go-to for anything pet related! Whether it's advice to get a puppy to behave or a panicked phone call to find out where to start looking for our escaped fur babies - Rachel is always happy to help! If you're looking for a trustworthy, reliable, and compassionate pet sitting service, look no further than Blue Ginger Pet Sitting. Rachel and her team are the best in the business, and we feel lucky to have them in our lives. Highly recommended! ü§ù",

      "We had never used a pet sitter before, but Rachel immediately put our minds at ease. She was friendly, clearly an animal lover, and took amazing care of our two boys. The regular updates and photos were the cherry on top, giving us total peace of mind while we were away. When Rachel wasn't available for our second trip, we were so grateful that Lisa was able to step in. She was just as wonderful, ensuring our boys were happy and well cared for. We will only ever use Blue Ginger Petsitting and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a caring, reliable pet sitter. It's such a relief knowing our cats are loved just as much in our absence as they are when we're home!",

      "We are so grateful to Rachel for looking after our two fur babies while we were away! Even though she had never met our cats before, she connected with them so naturally. They were so loved, played with lots, and completely spoiled with treats and cuddles. It was such a relief knowing they were in such caring hands. We will definitely be using Rachel again and highly recommend her to anyone needing a kind, reliable pet sitter! üêà‚Äç‚¨õüêàüíõüíú",
